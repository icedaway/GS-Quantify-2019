# GS-Quantify-2019
The problem is identified as a text clustering task.
Dataset contains logs occurring with a certain pattern, leading to the formation of clusters

### Data cleaning steps - 
Lower casing, Punctuation removal, Stopwords removal, Rare words removal, Tokenization, Lemmatization. NLTK & TextBlob functions were used for cleaning.

### Text Transformation - 
Experimented following transformation methods
1. TF-IDF Vectorization - [here](https://github.com/pranavpawar3/GS-Quantify-2019/blob/master/Final_Code_pretrained.ipynb)
2. Word2Vec Transformation (Pretrained) - [here](https://github.com/pranavpawar3/GS-Quantify-2019/blob/master/Final_Code_transfer_pretrained.ipynb)
